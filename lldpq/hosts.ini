# HOSTS.INI - LLDPq Topology Generation Host List
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This file defines additional hostnames for topology generation that may not
#   be present in assets.ini. Used by generate_topology.py and generate_topology_full.py
#   to ensure all network devices are included in the topology visualization.
#
# FORMAT:
#   - One hostname per line (simple text format)
#   - Lines starting with '#' are comments (ignored)
#   - Lines starting with '[' are section headers (ignored)
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Patterns with '*' are supported (wildcard matching)
#
# USAGE:
#   - Add device hostnames that should appear in topology but aren't in assets.ini
#   - Useful for devices that can't be monitored but exist in LLDP neighbor data
#   - Helps create complete network topology visualization
#   - Use patterns to match multiple devices at once
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   # Exact hostnames
#   spine-01
#   spine-02
#   
#   # Pattern - all devices containing "dgx"
#   *dgx*
#
#   # Pattern - all devices starting with "leaf-"
#   leaf-*
#
#   # Pattern - all devices ending with "-gpu"
#   *-gpu
#
# NOTE:
#   If a hostname exists in both assets.ini and hosts.ini, the assets.ini data
#   takes precedence for device details (IP, MAC, Serial, Model, Version).
#   This file only provides hostname information for topology mapping.
#   Patterns are matched against devices discovered via LLDP neighbor data.
#

# (One hostname per line, patterns with * supported)
