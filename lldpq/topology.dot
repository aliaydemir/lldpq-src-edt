 * TOPOLOGY.DOT - LLDPq Expected Network Topology Definition
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   This file defines the expected/designed network topology connections.
 *   Used by generate_topology.py and generate_topology_full.py to validate
 *   actual LLDP-discovered connections against the intended network design.
 *
 * FORMAT:
 *   GraphViz DOT format - defines network connections as graph edges
 *   "DeviceA":"InterfaceX" -- "DeviceB":"InterfaceY"
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   - Topology validation: Compare LLDP discoveries vs expected design
 *   - Missing link detection: Identify cables not connected as designed
 *   - Network documentation: Visual representation of intended topology
 *   - Change management: Track topology modifications over time
 *
 * VALIDATION LOGIC:
 *   - ✅ LLDP matches DOT: Connection is correct
 *   - ❌ LLDP missing from DOT: Unexpected connection found
 *   - ⚠️  DOT missing from LLDP: Expected connection not found (missing cable)
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *   graph "NETWORK_NAME" {
 *     "Hostname1":"Interface1" -- "Hostname2":"Interface2"
 *     "Leaf01":"swp49" -- "Spine01":"swp1"
 *   }
 *
 * MAINTENANCE:
 *   - Add new connections when cables are installed
 *   - Remove connections when cables are removed  
 *   - Update when devices/interfaces are renamed
 *   - Keep synchronized with physical network changes
 *
 * NOTE:
 *   Hostnames must match those in devices.yaml and assets.ini for proper
 *   correlation. Interface names must match actual device interface naming.
